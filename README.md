# Task-Scheduler-with-Recurring-Events-and-Notifications
**Task Scheduler** is a web application built using React that allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks. The tasks are scheduled for specific dates and times, with an option to make them recurring. The task list is displayed in a calendar format and interacts with a backend server for task management.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, Axios
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express) (assuming from your axios usage; modify if different)
- **Styling:** CSS for layout and design
- **Database:** (assumed, modify accordingly, e.g., MongoDB or SQL)

## To Run the Project Locally, Follow These Steps:

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd task-scheduler
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```


This will start the React development server, and the application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
